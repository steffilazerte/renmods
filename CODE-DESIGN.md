# Code Design

## Be careful

- Is the update frequency in `renmods()$update` appropriate?
- `cache_meta()` uses `extract_date_range()` to pull the original file
  name from the downloaded `*.csv.gz`. Currently that is a date range
  for the file, which is how we get the date ranges of different data
  sets. However, if the file names change this might break.
- Note the custom `ask()` function which always returns `TRUE` if in a
  non-interactive session.
- The `ask()` function also uses
  [`rlang::is_interactive()`](https://rlang.r-lib.org/reference/is_interactive.html)
  which works better with testthat (always assumes ‘FALSE’ in tests)
- Current data types are: `this_yr`, `yr_2_5`, `yr_5_10`, `historic`
  - If these change, modify `zzz.R` - `renmods.urls` option and types in
    `renmods()$types`

## Future ideas

- Is it possible to download in parallel with
  [furrr](https://furrr.futureverse.org/)
- Are there likely to be data versions for ENMODS? Is tracking the last
  date of download and the date range of the files sufficient to track
  this?

## Style

- Use R version \>= 4.1 with native pipe (`|>`) and `\(x)` anonymous
  functions
- Try to always check inputs at the top of a function
- Use Air formatter (`air.toml` and for Positron, `.vscode/*`
  - Setup in
    [RStudio](https://posit-dev.github.io/air/editor-rstudio.html)
  - Prebundled in
    [Positron](https://posit-dev.github.io/air/editor-vscode.html)
- Use [cli](https://cli.r-lib.org/) for messages/errors
- Try to avoid downloading data in tests
  - use `local_mocked_bindings()` to mock
  - Includes several tests which can only be run locally, use
    `skip_if_no_cache()`

## Workflow

The workflow is hopefully very simple:

- [`renmods_update()`](http://steffilazerte.ca/renmods/reference/renmods_update.md) -
  Download and cache data locally
- [`renmods_connect()`](http://steffilazerte.ca/renmods/reference/renmods_connect.md) -
  Connect to \*.csv.gz files
- [`collect()`](http://steffilazerte.ca/renmods/reference/collect.md) -
  Retrieve data to R data.frame/tibble (reexported from dplyr)
- [`renmods_disconnect()`](http://steffilazerte.ca/renmods/reference/renmods_disconnect.md) -
  Disconnect from the data base

There are also a family of `cache_xxx()` functions for controlling the
cache.

## Options (`zzz.R`)

- Options are set in `zzz.R` via `.onLoad()`
- Options include:
  - `renmods.cache_dir`: Where to store downloaded data (defaults to
    `NULL`)
  - `renmods.urls`: URLs for four data types
- Options are only set if they aren’t already present

## Internal data via functions (`zzz.R`)

- [`renmods()`](http://steffilazerte.ca/renmods/reference/renmods-package.md)
  is an internal function (in `zzz.R`) that lists
  - Data types available (‘this_yr’, ‘yr_2_5’, ‘yr_5_10’, ‘historic’)
  - Update intervals (in weeks) for each type
- This could be a data set, but I don’t think it needs to be

## Cache (`cache.R`)

- Cache functions are in `cache.R`
- Users can see
  - [`cache_dir()`](http://steffilazerte.ca/renmods/reference/cache_dir.md)
    (checks and creates directory)
  - [`cache_status()`](http://steffilazerte.ca/renmods/reference/cache_status.md)
    (returns data frame of cached files, download dates, date ranges,
    and file paths)
  - [`cache_remove()`](http://steffilazerte.ca/renmods/reference/cache_remove.md)
    (remove parts or whole of cache)
- `cache_path()` and `cache_meta()` are internal
  - `cache_meta()` is very similar to
    [`cache_status()`](http://steffilazerte.ca/renmods/reference/cache_status.md)
    but is also used to update/reset the cache metadata.
  - `cache_meta()` uses `extract_date_range()` to pull the original file
    name from the downloaded `*.csv.gz`. Currently that is a date range
    for the file, but if the file names change this might break.
- Cache functions are meant to check for cache, create cache and prompt
  updates as needed. It is sometimes a bit convoluted and they are
  extremely chatty, so it might be worth adding silencing options in
  future

## Downloads (`download.R`)

- Downloads shouldn’t redownload data unless `force = TRUE` if the data
  is a) present and b) within so many weeks of having been updated (see
  `renmods()$update`)
- Use `renmods_update_()` as an internal function so we can download out
  of date/missing data when the
  [`renmods_connect()`](http://steffilazerte.ca/renmods/reference/renmods_connect.md)
  function is used without all the chatter.

## Database (`db.R`)

- [`renmods_connect()`](http://steffilazerte.ca/renmods/reference/renmods_connect.md)
  combines and connects to all data by default
- Users can supply a date range or the data type they wish to connect to
- For a date range, we check the metadata and pick only the data types
  needed, then we prefilter the data by date.
- [`collect()`](http://steffilazerte.ca/renmods/reference/collect.md) is
  exported from dplyr (`re-exports.R`) so that users don’t have to use
  dplyr just to get the data.

## Other

- Standard checks are in `checks.R`
- Test utiliity functsion are in `test-utils.R`
- Random utility functions are in `utils.R`
  - One thing to note is that we have a custom `ask()` function which
    always returns `TRUE` if in a non-interactive session.
